### What is this website for?
Give a GIF Project website was created for fun during a hackaton in Code Institute.

Created with the following GitHub users: 
- /**hschafer**
- /**Miguelmargar**

Developed further by:

### How does it work
 
This website uses **Java-Script** and **jQuery** to route viewers through the site. The site is styled with **Bootstrap**, **css3** and **Google Fonts**. Specific back end (restful-wrapper API) to meet the new requirements of the [GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/). The restful-API part was made using **flask** and **python3**. The back-end has its own CORS which are in this case deleted to be able to call it from the Front-End part of the project.
